Join us for our September Meetup, proudly hosted and sponsored by NewyTechPeople, where tech enthusiasts, great talks, and networking come together for an inspiring evening! Agenda 6.00pm Food 6.30pm Intro and Go News Talks LangChainGo Under Microscope Nanik Tolaram Building AI applications in Go is becoming increasingly accessible thanks to the growing number of open-source frameworks. In this talk, we’ll explore LangChainGo, one of the most popular frameworks for developing AI applications. We’ll demonstrate how to write an application that can call internal functions to retrieve information based on user questions. Additionally, we’ll dive into the framework itself to understand how it works and how it interacts with LLM providers like Google Gemini. --- Nanik is a prolific software engineer and active open-source contributor with deep expertise across multiple programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Go, and Python. He has extensive experience across the financial sector, spanning traditional banking to cryptocurrency. Nanik is also the author of two Golang books: “Becoming a Full Stack Go Developer” and “Software Development with Go: Cloud-Native Programming using Golang with Linux and Docker”. APIs Made Easy with Protobuf & ConnectRPC Yann Vigara https://www.linkedin.com/in/yvigara/ Tired of wrestling with OpenAPI or GraphQL to get your APIs working across backend and frontend? In this talk, I’ll show how Protobuf and ConnectRPC make it simple to define your API once and generate everything you need — typed clients for Go services, microservices, and even your React frontend. You’ll see a live demo where we build an end-to-end service in minutes, with the safety and flexibility of the best of all worlds.

Agenda: 6pm: Food and networking 6.30pm: Talks Talk Title: EDA’s reimagined - Choreography vs Orchestration Speaker: Gaurav Thadani Talk Summary: Getting your Event Design right is like Get Rich or Die Tryin.We’ve spoken about EDA’s; and emphasised on the importance of event design. The lack of discipline on the data published leads to a plethora of inconsistent structures and information out there in an organisation. Additionally, driving tech processes with business events generally is characterised as a choreography-driven approach. Similar to a dance, it requires every actor in the system to coordinate effectively and skillfully. The cost of maintenance and observation tends to rise over time, potentially hindering the developer experience. Imagine testing a business flow across many components that are listening to events, and then trying to observe the system's behavior as a whole. Join us as we explore and compare the approaches, including the challenges of choreography. In this talk, we’ll introduce Temporal, an open-source project (MIT license) that delivers durable execution. We'll demonstrate how orchestration can simplify your architecture, accelerate time to market, and boost developer productivity—all without 'boiling the ocean.' Talk Title: How Many Colours Are There? Talk Summary: An exploration of digital precision, human perception, and color spaces for screen and lighting. RGB, HSV, XY color space conversions in Go, the difference between screen color and lighting color, building a color library from internet resources Esme will run some practical code examples to show the loss of precision in the conversion process And talk a bit about the mysterious RYB color wheel that she’s been reading about from the art/painting world of color theory, which predates all this. Bio: Esme is a Staff Software Engineer at Slack going on 7 years. She has been writing Go for a little over 8 years. She has worked on cloud infrastructure, platform tools, and reliability at scale for Slack’s largest codebases. Outside of work she's a classic house and disco DJ with a background in light and sound tech. Her cats are named Erasmus and Princess. She is passionate about simple and clean software that is easy and fun to use. Interested in speaking at an upcoming event? We will aim to have a mix of short (~10min) and in-depth (20-30min) talks.

Agenda 6.00pm Food 6.30pm Intro A Golang Engineer’s Guide to What Matters and What Doesn’t Supreet Sethi In the world of performance engineering, it’s easy to fall into the trap of premature optimization. This talk will explore the common areas where Golang developers spend significant time and effort optimizing, yet see minimal returns. From micro-optimizations like loop unrolling and manual inlining, to excessive memory management and the overuse of goroutines, we’ll highlight why some of these practices do little to improve performance and often make code harder to maintain. Attendees will learn why focusing on real bottlenecks—discovered through profiling and benchmarking—is far more productive than obsessing over minor code tweaks. We’ll dive into why Go’s garbage collector, built-in concurrency, and efficient memory handling mean that developers can often avoid over-optimization in areas like memory allocation, low-level syscalls, and custom object pools. This session will challenge the notion that every piece of code needs to be highly optimized, advocating instead for simplicity, readability, and focusing optimization efforts where they truly matter. It’s time to stop sweating the small stuff and start trusting Go’s built-in strengths. Interested in speaking at an upcoming event? We’re excited to hear you speak on a Go related topic you love.

It is the most important challenge in software design. It is what makes systems hard to build and maintain. If good design is an important goal for you, then the presented ideas should make programming more fun for you and your team. A clean, simple and obvious design is a beautiful thing that is hard to achieve.

We'll start with a quick overview of WebAssembly, then delve into its application with Golang. I'll share demonstrations where I compile and run a Golang program as WebAssembly in both a web browser and a backend, highlighting the advantages, such as enhanced performance and the ability to use various languages in the backend with Golang. For a balanced viewpoint, I'll also touch on some limitations of integrating Golang with WebAssembly. The aim of this talk is to provide a few starting points if you're thinking of using Golang and WebAssembly in your upcoming projects. About Tuong Tuong is an experienced software engineer with more than 15 years in the industry. His interests range from micro-services to chatbots, front end development and everything in between.

Agenda Food Intro / Welcome Talks: How to let a CLI tool have pretty and useful output Arjen Schwarz Almost 7 years ago, I wrote a tool that allowed me to run complex commands against AWS and output that into a nice format. 5 years later I created another tool that could really use those same outputs. Eventually this resulted in a re-usable library that can generate regular output a large number of outputs ranging from CLI-based coloured outputs, to tables, and even various forms of diagrams. In this talk I aim to go through this library and show how I use it to make my life easier, more colourful, and filled with emoji :sunglasses: Mocking in Go with Testify/Mockery Mirjam Uher In this talk, Mirjam will walk the audience through the art of mocking with the Testify/Mockery libraries. Starting from the basics she will share some theory (Why do we mock? Why don't we just use manual mocking?) before demonstrating live how to uplift your code to introduce autogenerated mocks and use them in table tests. She'll also visit more advanced mocking strategies, and spend a bit of time explaining what made her convert from the biggest GoMock library supporter to dedicated Mockery-fan.

Semgrep is used to write and run security and correctness queries on source code (for Go, Python, Java, JS, and C) with a simple grep-like interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep's predecessor, Coccinelle, for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook. He's now full time at r2c where we're continuing its development. Semgrep is open-source and comes with a registry of OWASP Top 10 security checks. It's ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts. Source code: https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep . Generics Draft Proposal Review Bill Kennedy @goinggodotnet With the release of the new draft proposal for generics, Go. inches closer to having a version of generics in the language. It's important that the community as a whole agrees this new language feature feels like Go and will add value to the language and the applications we build. In this talk, Bill Kennedy will review the major aspects of the draft proposal with code samples. He will spend time teaching different aspects of the new syntax and show how generics can help make Go programs more readable when it's reasonable and practical to use generics. After the presentation will ask questions to the group to get feedback and opinions.",

This is about troubleshooting a new side project at home. The great wonderful world of the Sysl specification language Joshua Carpeggiani and Marcelo Cantos Sysl (pronounced \"sizzle\") is a system specification language. Using Sysl, you can specify systems, endpoints, endpoint behaviour, data models and data transformations. The Sysl compiler automatically generates sequence diagrams, integrations, and other views. It also offers a range of code generation options, all from one common Sysl specification. This demonstration will be using sysl in a go program to demonstrate how easy development could be. (Sysl isn’t “strictly” go specific, although everything from its implementation to its usage is all in go) AGENDA 6:00pm: Drinks, Networking 6:15pm: Intro, First Talk 6.45pm: Food! 7.15pm: Second Talk 8:00pm to 8.30pm Wrap-up, Q&A, Networking and hometime!

Service discovery out of the box will make a dns request through Kube-DNS. Kube-DNS is (currently [^coredns]) a pod running dnsmasq with a custom integration to watch events straight off the Kubernetes api. Loadbalancing is provided out of the box by Kube-proxy. Which provides TCP stream balancing inside the cluster. There is an implementation using IPVS coming but that’s outside the scope of this intro. These two helpers provide a well rounded solution that fits many use cases but in some use cases the limits with these generic solutions are somewhat visible. This talk will go into swapping out Kube-proxy with other methods of discovering and show how a system can get away from using Kube-DNS entirely\" Got a talk suggestion?

The daemon consumes temperature data generated by an ESP8266, stores it inside InfluxDB and is visualised in real-time on a chart using Grafana. Got a talk suggestion?

Dave's talk is one that he will later give at GopherChina, so we've got the chance to hear him do so before then. The hidden #pragmas of Go Go isn’t like C. It doesn’t have a preprocessor, it doesn’t have macros, and it certainly doesn’t have #define, but Go does have pragmas. What are pragmas? The name come from the #pragma declaration that tells C compilers to alter their interpretation of a piece of code. Now, Go doesn’t have a #pragma directive, but it does have ways of altering the operation of the Go compiler via directive syntax hidden in comments. This talk will explore the history of these directives, how and why they are used, and how you can, but probably shouldn’t, use them in your own code. ---- As usual we'll kick of at 6:30 with beer and pizza that are sponsored by 99designs, who have also offered to host us once again. Looking forward to see you all in March!",

This month the great people at 99designs are offering their space for our use so please keep in mind that we'll be in Richmond instead of the CBD. Additionally we'll be going for a different format again. There won't be a presentation! Before you immediately decline the invitation, hear us out. We often have really great presentations (and for a complete list look at the GitHib repo ( https://github.com/golang-melbourne/presentations ) containing links to them), but there is lots of knowledge among all of us so what we're aiming for this time is a group discussion centred around a single question: What libraries or frameworks do you use? These can be things you've built yourself or have found somewhere else. We believe that discussing these can ensure that we learn from each other about how people use Go and what is useful with it. Of course, we'll also do a quiz again because those are fun. So, please join us for this discussion. Even if you're new to Go, it should be useful to come along and learn which libraries and frameworks are worth spending time on. Hope to see you there!

We'll have over $150K worth of prizes on offer (ranging from $500 to $5,000), including the Melbourne 'Beautiful Data' prize: http://au.okfn.org/2013/05/08/beautiful-data-govhack/ We would love to see your community come along to enjoy this free event, as well as win some of the prizes (hopefully more than the other seven Australian cities competing #friendlyrivalry #melbournerules ;-) http://www.govhack.org/locations/ The event launches Friday evening at 6pm, with lots of fun networking activities (have you ever experienced balloon bingo?!), and of course the announcing of all the prizes on offer <-- the Fri evening will just be about drinks, nibbles, fun and meeting like-minded good do-ers (so you don't have to compete if you don't want to, just check it out). If you do want to compete we'll have hacking space open all day on Saturday and Sunday at MediaHouse (June 1 & 2). Contestants will need to submit a three minute video by Sunday evening to enter the competition. Last year 1/3 of the team that entered won a prize, let alone all the networking opportunities to build your community. In short, we really hope you will come along and bring your fellow hackers! Tickets are going very quickly so please do get people to book ASAP: http://govhack2013.eventbrite.com.au/ Greatly appreciated for any considerations. Please don't hesitate to email or tweet me if you have any questions: david.flanders@ands.org.au (Australian National Data Service). @DFFlanders Hope to see you there :) -Flanders",
